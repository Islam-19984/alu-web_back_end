Unit tests and integration tests are both important types of software testing, but they focus on different aspects of an application. Here's a breakdown of both:

Unit Tests
Definition: Unit testing involves testing individual components or units of a software application in isolation from the rest of the system.
Focus: The focus is on testing the smallest functional parts of an application, such as functions, methods, or classes.
Goal: The goal is to verify that each unit of code performs as expected in all possible cases.
Scope: Narrow scope, usually involving a single function or module.
Speed: Unit tests are generally fast to execute because they are testing isolated pieces of code.
Tools: Common tools for unit testing include frameworks like JUnit (Java), PyTest or unittest (Python), JUnit (JavaScript), and XCTest (Swift).
Integration Tests
Definition: Integration testing checks how different modules or components work together. It tests the interaction between units and how they collaborate to complete specific tasks.
Focus: The focus is on the flow of data and control between integrated units to ensure they work properly as a group.
Goal: The goal is to find issues that arise when combining different components, such as incorrect data exchange or interaction problems.
Scope: Broader scope compared to unit tests because it involves multiple components or modules.
Speed: Integration tests are typically slower than unit tests because they involve more parts of the system.
Tools: Common tools for integration testing include Selenium (for web applications), JUnit (for Java), and pytest (for Python).
Key Differences
Granularity: Unit tests focus on a small piece of code in isolation, while integration tests focus on the collaboration between different pieces of the code.
Dependencies: Unit tests avoid external dependencies (like databases or file systems), whereas integration tests often involve multiple dependencies and real-world systems.
Both are crucial for a well-rounded testing strategyâ€”unit tests ensure individual components function correctly, and integration tests ensure that those components work together seamlessly
